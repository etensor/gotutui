# Gotutui
## TUI Elements combined

The order of execution is not yet well defined. I have been playing with the library charmbracelet/bubbletea+lipgloss
and marcusolsson/tui-go provides.

> To run make sure to have go installed, is really easy to do if you haven't done it already.

After you have go installed correctly, you are ready to go. This works ok in ubuntu20.04 LTS WSL2.

### Usage:

```zsh
    go run TUIe1.go
    # Then get inmersed in such magic. xd

```

I really made this to check how to make TUIs with go.
